            Navigating this place is one of the most fundamental things to do,
             for most people, this will be trivial, but others might need it.
             If you feel like you know better, you can skip this and any others
             book you want. Guidance is for those who need and want it.
        </p>

            The most basic and simple way to navigate is through <em>hyperlinks</em>.
             You should be familiar with them, as they are what you used to arrive
             here. They usually look like <a class="button" href="help2Navigation.html">this</a>,
             though sometimes they might look like <a class="hidden-button" href="help2Navigation.html">this</a>.
             Those are <em>hidden buttons</em>, you'll have to keep your eyes peeled for them.
        </p>

        <p>
            Another way to travel through this place is by <em>manually typing in page names</em>.
             To do this, go to your <em>adress bar</em>. You should be seeing something like this:<br>
             <blockquote>"https://yu-wei-luo.github.io/ bobaWebsite/help/ help2Navigation.html"</blockquote>
        </p>

        <p class="divider"><b>~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~</b></p>

        <p>
            This is
             what you'll be rewriting to forcefully inject yourself into pages. Specifically
             the part that reads: "help/help2Navigation.html". The very last part after
             the last slash is <em>the name of the page</em>. It's usually something similar to "name.html".
             Every other part are called <em>page folders</em>. For example, the previously mentioned page
             was in the folder "help", and is called "help2Navigation.html". If you want to navigate
             to certain pages, you'll have to use this method, and you'll have to make sure that
             the page name and it's folders are correctly written, else it won't work!
